monNSRothC is the python code for implementig the nonstandard version of the RothC model for simaluting the dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) contained in the organic matter. 

Five compartments of the soil are considered: DPM (decomposable plant material), RPM (resistant plant material), BIO (microbial biomass), HUM (humified organic matter) and IOM (inert organic matter).

The implementation of this code was carried out within the framework of :
•	the H2020 project “Earth Observation Training in Science and Technology at the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences’— ’EOTiST”’, funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 952111.
•	the project "CIR01_00028 LifeWatchPLUS- LifeWatch, infrastructure for research on biodiversity and ecosystems Project to strengthen infrastructure - Strengthening human capital" with research topic: "Implementation in virtual research environments of modelling tools to predict and prevent the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services"  funded by “National Research Council” (CNR). 

The routine can be used under the conditions of CC-BY-NC 2.0.
